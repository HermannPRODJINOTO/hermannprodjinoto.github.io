  title: Hello!
  body: >
    Welcome to my website. I am a young Post-doc in plant science. My work aims at understanding how environmental stresses affect plant physiology and identifying innovative traits that allow adapted crops/genotypes to improve their tolerance strategies and to maintain an economically viable yield under stress conditions. I can define myself as a plant physiologist who examines the bases of exceptional stress tolerance through the investigation of underlying physiological mechanisms. This approach allows to unravel the mechanistic basis of highly promising traits and to refine targets for further genetic investigations. I also acquired crop modeling skills to validate new traits over large range of environments.
